How does Meta Quest tracking works?
controllers - constillation tracking
Inertial measurement inside controllers to track rotation

Eye tracking - Quest has IR sensing/ sendign IR into eyes to get the movement of eyes, problem with having glasses i.e., 4 eyes

What makes 3D interaction difficult?
 - 8 things in slides, out of which lack of standards is the major one.

Universal 3D Interaction Tasks in 3D:
1) Object Interaction:
    Selection & Manuplation comes under this.

**Selection**

**Manuplation**

Selection & Manuplation Tasks:
- Canonical Tasks
    Selection, positioning, Rotating, Scaling

Selection & Manuplation Techniques:

Grips:

Clutching:
    when we use mouse we face this, when we ran out of space in physical world we lift the mouse and reset i.e., put it in the center.

Classification by Task Decomposition:

Classification Metaphors:
- Grasping - selecting 

Grasping - Go-Go Technique
    Inspector gadget - old american cartoon - gogo gadget
    This is an arm extension technique.
    Ex: Hand moves in the 3D to far to get an object, in physical world user needs not to move that distance to get the object, only the hand moves, it's like an hand extension.

    Enhancements: 
        - PRISM
        MOving the controller in same velocity as the obects moving in 3D, so that we can control
