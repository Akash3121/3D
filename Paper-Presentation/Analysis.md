**Influencing Factors:** The study identifies that the nature of tasks and the design of Virtual Environments (VEs) are key factors influencing VR sickness levels. The interactivity between users and VEs and the degree of user control is a critical factor.

Conducted in FPP Racing game

Method:

To find information loss, 60 balloons 3 sets 20 each 

1- easy - balloon appear in FOV (donot need)
2- normal - balloon appear in half of horizontal distance of easy. (slightly need)
3- hard - balloon appear within l but outside normal level view (necessarily need)

design, task & procedure:

- degree of control as between-subject factor - divided into separate groups, and each group experiences a different level of control. one group might have a high degree of control, while another group has a low degree of control.

- technique as within subject factor - participants are exposed to multiple techniques, and their responses are measured for each technique.

**Procedure**: 


**Results**
The key findings were that there were no significant differences in VR sickness, presence, and workload among the techniques and control levels. However, both FOV reduction and DOF blurring resulted in some degree of information loss. The study suggests that frequent FOV changes and inappropriate DOF blurring levels can increase discomfort.


I think study on only 32students so there is no significant difference in sickness, presence and workload
