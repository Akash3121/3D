Rubric - 1: added 2 planes, 
**check with jerald** - cube has a quad with tag teleportation but it is elevated, when I point the ray towards the cube it will hit the quad so how to do?

- For Teleplane -2 slightly rotated the plane so that I can point the ray

Rubric - 2: done
Rubric - 3: done
rubric - 4: done - need to check after adding the gameObjects into the scene
{All teleportation targets are pink in color}
rubric - 5: done
rubric - 6: done - using LThumbstick movement, - **check with jerald** - By default the arrow points towards the player. 
rubric - 7: done - **check with jerald**, we need to point the OVRrig as the same direction as arrow pointing right?


**By Default the arrow points towards the ray** - not getting how to change this

other than that, whatever side the arrow is pointing the rig is moving/rotating in that direction
